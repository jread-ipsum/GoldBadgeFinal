# GoldBadgeFinal
Welcome to my Gold Badge Final Challenges project!

This solution is broken down into three folders.  One for each challenge.  
Challenge 1: Cafe  
  This challenge has 4 projects: CafePOCO, CafeRepo, CafeUnitTest, and CafeUI.  This console app allows a user to build out a menu for a cafe by adding menu items, deleting menu   items, and showing a completed menu.
 
Challenge 2:  Claims
  This challenge has 4 projects: ClaimsPOCO, ClaimsRepo, ClaimsUnitTest, and ClaimsUI.  This console app allow a user to see a Queued list of insurance claims by the order they are entered, new claims can be added to the queue, and the user can choose to handle the next claim in the queue.
  
Challenge 3:  Badges
  This challenge has 4 projects: BadgesPOCO, BadgesReop, BadgesUnitTest, and BadgesUI.  This console app allows a user to add door access badges to a database.  Each badge can be assigned a set of doors to allow access too.  The user can also add or delete door access on an existing badge.  User can also see a complete list of all badges and the doors assigned to those badges.  
  
  I hope you enjoy using these apps!
